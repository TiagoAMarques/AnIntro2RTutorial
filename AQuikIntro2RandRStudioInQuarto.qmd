## Objective

A quick introduction to the topics to be used in courses that require such introduction, including TAM's courses Ecologia Numérica and Modelação Ecológica at FCUL

but also to support the self paced learning github repository hosted at <https://github.com/TiagoAMarques/AnIntro2RTutorial>

## Learning goals

-   Obtain a working knowledge about the R software and environment, to be able to implement basic data analysis

-   Integration of R and RStudio, an helpful R interface, via a short introduction to R and RStudio followed by a hands on assisted tutorial

## The R environment

-   R is both a programming language and an environment for statistical computation
-   R is free open source software
-   Created in 1995 by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman, Department of Statistics of the University of Auckland
-   gets its name from another famous programming language for data analysis, S
-   Project run by the "R Core Development Team"
-   Software and many resources available at the [r-project.org/](http://www.r-project.org)

-   R base installation comes with a number of libraries which provide access to a large number of commonly used features (e.g. linear models, survival analysis, basic statistical distributions, etc)
-   One of R's key strengths comes from the fact that many more packages are available online, under constant increase

-   Here we focus on Rstudio, a program to interface with R, making many of the most common tasks simpler. Let's open Rstudio shall we?

## Creating a dynamic report I

Let us create a dynamic report from scratch in RMarkdown via RStudio

![](extfiles/NewRmd.png){.absolute top="200" left="50" width="1000" height="450"}

## Set Title and author

Let us create a dynamic report from scratch in RMarkdown via RStudio

![](extfiles/TitleAuthor.png){.absolute top="200" left="50" width="1000" height="450"}

## Almost there

This is what you should be seeing. Check your title and name are there.

![](extfiles/ThereItIs.png){.absolute top="200" left="50" width="1000" height="450"}

## Compile the .Rmd

To do so press the "Knit" button. After you do you are asked to save the files, tell RStudio where it should do so it and what is the file name (I am using "My1stDynamicReport.Rmd")

![](extfiles/knit.png){.absolute top="250" left="50" width="1000" height="450"}

## If you run into issues

Regarding "latin" characters showing, like say "é", "õ" and â"

![](extfiles/encoding.png){.absolute top="200" left="50" width="1000" height="450"}

## Et voilá

Your first dynamic report is ready

![](extfiles/DynDone.png){.absolute top="150" left="50" width="1000" height="550"}

## If you want it in the viewer pane

Unless you have customized RStudio to do otherwise, the html appears in a new window. To have it in the viewer pane, change the options under `Tools| Global Options`

![](extfiles/OptionsG.png){.absolute top="250" left="50" width="1000" height="500"}

## Possible outputs

-   Your now have your first HTML automatically generated, obtained from compiling (=knitting) the .Rmd file ("My1stDynamicReport.Rmd").

-   Actually, the output could also be a Word file or a PDF.

-   Not all possible features are available in word

-   Generating PDF's requires some additional software (LaTex) - you can try that on your own. Good luck ;)

## Experiment with the .Rmd file

-   Try to insert a new bit of code with `Code|insert chunck` (shortcut `Ctrl+Al+I`)

-   Change a chunck's options (e.g. `eval`, `echo`, etc) from `TRUE` to `FALSE` and see what whappens to the output

-   Try to use dynamic numbers like this one: `r mean(rnorm(5))` printing the mean value of 5 random Gaussian numbers. For that you need to use something like \`? mean(rnorm(5))\` (note: replace the "?" with the leter "r" so that it knows you want to run r code).

-   For more, check e.g. the [RMarkdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/main/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf)

## Warning: command line vs .Rmd

![](extfiles/warning.png){fig-align="center"}

-   When you run some code within a .Rmd, it is only run in the .Rmd

-   When you run some code in the command line, it is only run in the command line

-   Therefore, reading the data in the command line does NOT mean it will be available for a dynamic report, and vice versa!

## Tips and Tricks

-   It is much safer to compile the entire document than to run code chunks separately

-   An .Rmd is not a usual script, it has both code and text. The result is a dynamic document, with Text, Code, and OUTPUTS of the code

-   The code must go always, always, always inside a code chunck!

-   Comments to the code can also be within code chunks (preceded by "\#" -- the hash symbol).

```{r,echo=TRUE}
# EXAMPLE: this would be a comment
# run the next lines of code the result is 11
A<-3;B<-8;A+B
```

BE PROACTIVE: EXPLORE RESOURCES

## An example of the usefulness of dynamic reports

The following activity allows you to see the life/time saving usefullness of dynamic reports if you are someone that does data analysis. Check in folder "ExampleDataAnalysis" at

<https://github.com/TiagoAMarques/AnIntro2RTutorial>

1.  Open ExampleDataAnalysis.Rmd
2.  Compile it and see the results
3.  Implement the last few actions
4.  Recompile the report
5.  Compare the results obtained

## And finally...

Open the hands on R tutorial ("TAMsIntro2RviaRStudioTutorial.pdf") and work through it

![](extfiles/Rtut.png){fig-align="center"}

## If you are seeing this slide

It is because you either:

1.  have completed the tutorial (well done you, keep it going!)
2.  are being shown the slide in class by me/someone (and hence might do the tutorial next, go for it!)
3.  are not following the rules if working alone (shame on you ;), but hey, rules are meant to be broken, YOLO.

Next couple of slides are about learning more about R on your own. Besides all the stuff at the landing page of my github repository here:

<https://github.com/TiagoAMarques/AnIntro2RTutorial>

You can try a couple of things

## Teach yourself

A great place to start [Ten simple rules for teaching yourself R](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6j5byl93z54hcpw/journal.pcbi.1010372.pdf?dl=0)

![](extfiles/TenSimple.png){.absolute top="150" left="100" width="1000" height="600"}

## Get a (virtual) R Tutor

You can find one within the [swirl R package](https://swirlstats.com/): try it out!

![](extfiles/swirl.png){fig-align="center"}

## And now, off you go!

The path to R mastery is winding, but the reward is worth it...
