# An Intro 2 RTutorial

This is a tutorial that can be used by students to get working with R. I use it for both my Ecologia Numérica and my Modelação Ecológica at FCUL courses. If you are a student, please bear in mind that the final task, " A final task integrating all of the above", is only intended to be completed for those in "Modelação Ecológica".

To use the tutorial you should download the following files

- TAMsIntro2RviaRStudioTutorial.html and/or TAMsIntro2RviaRStudioTutorial.html
- dados1.csv
- mydatafile.txt

The main file you should use to work through the tutorial is either TAMsIntro2RviaRStudioTutorial.html or TAMsIntro2RviaRStudioTutorial.pdf, depending on your preference. These files are created by compiling TAMsIntro2RviaRStudioTutorial.Rmd, which is a dynamic report in RMarkdown.

If you want a template for creating dynamic reports, there is one here:

https://github.com/TiagoAMarques/RMarkdownTemplate

My suggestion is that you start by creating your own dynamic report which you then use as a basis to use the code and experiment variations of the code. Please keep all your code properly commented: what seems obvious to you today might not be obvious to the "you" next week.

If you are new to RStudio, there is also a powerpoint with a presentation  that can be helpful is getting started: Quick introduction to R and R Studio.pptx - https://github.com/TiagoAMarques/AnIntro2RTutorial/blob/master/Quick%20introduction%20to%20R%20and%20R%20Studio.pptx.
