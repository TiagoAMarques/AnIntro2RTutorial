# An Intro 2 RTutorial

This is a tutorial that can be used by students to get working with [R](https://www.r-project.org/) using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). I use it for both my Ecologia Numérica and my Modelação Ecológica at [FCUL](https://ciencias.ulisboa.pt/en) courses. If you are a student, please bear in mind that the final task, " A final task integrating all of the above", is only intended to be completed for those in "Modelação Ecológica".

To use the tutorial you should download the following files

- TAMsIntro2RviaRStudioTutorial.html and/or TAMsIntro2RviaRStudioTutorial.html
- dados1.csv
- mydatafile.txt

The main file you should use to work through the tutorial is either "TAMsIntro2RviaRStudioTutorial.html"" or "TAMsIntro2RviaRStudioTutorial.pdf"", depending on your preference. These files are created by compiling #TAMsIntro2RviaRStudioTutorial.Rmd#, which is a dynamic report in [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

If you want a template for creating dynamic reports, there is one here:

https://github.com/TiagoAMarques/RMarkdownTemplate

My suggestion is that you start by creating your own dynamic report which you then use as a basis to use the code and experiment variations of the code. Please keep all your code properly commented: what seems obvious to you today might not be obvious to the "you" next week.

If you are new to RStudio, there is also a powerpoint with a presentation  that can be helpful is getting started: [Quick introduction to R and R Studio](https://github.com/TiagoAMarques/AnIntro2RTutorial/blob/master/Quick%20introduction%20to%20R%20and%20R%20Studio.pptx)

If you are new to R in general, the [R cheat sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) are great resources, and I recommend to begin with downloading these:

- [base R](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/base-r.pdf)
- [RMarkdown](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)
